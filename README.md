Hello! I'm Carlos.
I'm passionate about technology, development, and innovation. At the age of 30, I completely shifted the focus of my career. I left Law and transitioned into the IT field, starting to study and develop projects as a freelancer. I am constantly seeking improvement in both frontend and backend technologies.

Currently, Iâ€™ve been specializing in low-code technologies, such as Microsoftâ€™s Power Platform, always aiming for maximum efficiency in solution development.
Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, always keeping up with new trends and challenging myself to go further, with a commitment to becoming a more complete developer.

- ðŸ”­ I have some solid knowledge on: JavaScript, PHP, C#. I am currently learning a little bit of node.js
